Well, I donâ€™t know why, but Fridays are usually associated with good moods. For us Kenyans, we call it Furahi Day (meaning a day full of happiness) and all memes about it are celebratory. 
Well, the energy is just right and all the feel good hormones are released. A good number of people throng social joints to celebrate the day. At work/school, youâ€™d hear people saying their â€œFridayâ€œ starts at 2 pm or earlier. Youâ€™d hear colleagues joking with each other, â€œClose your laptop beloved, you have done enough, itâ€™s Friday!!â€œ . Anyway, it is FurahiDay today, so, Happy Furahi Day Beloveds, mine has just started

Project management support involves providing assistance and resources to ensure the successful planning, execution, and completion of projects. 

I am an enthusiast in planning and scheduling of projects in order to create detailed project plans, timelines, and schedules to ensure that all tasks are completed on time. Poor management might otherwise lead to undesired results.

Project management entails resource allocation in order to ensure that necessary resources (people, equipment, budget) are available and properly allocated to different tasks.
